# Cerebrium 2.0

Updating the previous project such that it will use ChakraUI instead of styled-components, up-to-date dependencies, lowering the costs of dependencies to lower processing time.

Small changes to UI/UX. Added documentation for multiple services that the company offers.

A presentation website for a psychology cabinet with multiple services which include new efficient devices in order to help their customers.

The website is used to showcase the services, allow the customers to read more about various afflictions and it has a contact page where they can get in touch with the psychologists.
